# Design Patterns Study Project

This project is dedicated to studying and implementing various software design patterns using Java. Each folder in the repository contains examples and implementations of a specific design pattern, demonstrating its structure, usage, and benefits.

## Structure

- `factory_method/`, `factory_method2/`, `factory_method3/` – Factory Method pattern examples
- `herança_polimorfismo/` – Inheritance and Polymorphism concepts
- `observer/`, `observer2/` – Observer pattern implementations
- `pattern_decorator/` – Decorator pattern examples
- `polimorfismo/`, `polimorfismo2/` – Polymorphism examples
- `prototype/` – Prototype pattern implementations
- `singleton/` – Singleton pattern examples
- `strategy/` – Strategy pattern implementations
- `substituição_de_liskov/` – Liskov Substitution Principle examples

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to provide practical examples of design patterns for learning and reference. Each pattern is implemented in a simple and clear way to facilitate understanding.
