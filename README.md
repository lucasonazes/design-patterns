# Design Patterns Study Project

This project is dedicated to studying and implementing various software design patterns using Java. Each folder in the repository contains examples and implementations of a specific design pattern, demonstrating its structure, usage, and benefits.

## Structure

- `factory_method/` – Factory Method pattern examples
- `factory_method2/`, `factory_method3/` – Additional Factory Method pattern variations
- `herança_polimorfismo/` – Inheritance and Polymorphism concepts
- `observer/`, `observer2/` – Observer pattern implementations
- `pattern_decorator/` – Decorator pattern examples
- `polimorfismo/`, `polimorfismo2/` – Polymorphism examples
- `prototype/` – Prototype pattern implementations
- `singleton/` – Singleton pattern examples
- `strategy/` – Strategy pattern implementations
- `substituição_de_liskov/` – Liskov Substitution Principle examples

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/design-patterns.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Explore each folder to study the implementation of different design patterns.
4. Compile and run the Java files to see the patterns in action.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to provide practical examples of design patterns for learning and reference. Each pattern is implemented in a simple and clear way to facilitate understanding.
